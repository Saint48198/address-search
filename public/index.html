<b>Outstanding to-do's:</b>
<ol>
<li>Why shadow DOM?  Learn.  Concerned about fitting in to larger UI HTML/CSS.
<li>Set max # of results someplace obvious, not magic number.
<li>Should "too many" warning be at the top or bottom of the list?  
     (Hard to see at bottom on small phones.)
<li>Experiment replacing extractHouseStreetCity() code with regex?
<li>Think about font-sizes, how results are displayed (wrap/indent if too long).
<li>Some kind of warning/suggestion for zero results, when user has typed "enough" characters.
<li>House # range display (if user does not type house #) is wide.&nbsp;  Do we care?&nbsp;
    How about "2100+ StreetName" instead of [2100-2200] StreetName" ?
<li>Thinking of replacing X button with an image; what issues do I need to worry about?
<li>2100 Hammond Place Center, Traverse city.  Shows as Garfield Township.  Do we care?
    Should we show both jurisdiction <b>and</b> postal-address city name?  Is that too long?
<li>Rd vs Road, etc.  Don't usually need it if user enters house #.  But potentially confusing.
</ol>

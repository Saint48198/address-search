<b>Outstanding to-do's:</b>
<ol>
<li>User has typed enough to reduce list to <b>one</b> address.&nbsp;
   Pressing enter should act like clicking on that address.&nbsp;
   (Otherwise ignored.)
<li>Set max # of results someplace obvious, not magic number.
<li>Should "too many" warning be at the top or bottom of the list?  
     (Hard to see at bottom on small phones.)
<li>Think about font-sizes, how results are displayed (wrap/indent if too long).
<li>Some kind of warning/suggestion for zero results, when user has typed "enough" characters.
<li>Thinking of replacing X button with an image; what issues do I need to worry about?
<li>Thinking about having the back-end scan the <b>entire</b> string after the house #,
    and parsing it there.&nbsp;
    In particular, if there is no comma and no results, looking for places to split
    out the city name from the street name.
</ol>
